        <li className="instructions--list__item"><span className="bold">Heat the pan</span>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        <li className="instructions--list__item"><span className="bold">Cook the omelette</span>: One the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
        <li className="instructions--list__item"><span className="bold">Add fillings (optional)</span>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li className="instructions--list__item"><span className="bold">Fold and serve</span>: As the omelette continues to cook carefully list one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li className="instructions--list__item"><span className="bold">Enjoy</span>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
